His ideology is rooted to his daily life experiences and encounters, navigating sociopolitical struggles and spiritual triumph of success. He is a trailblazer of many ideas, engaging off grid with “Mother Nature” that inspire and encompasses his creative work and cleanse his mind, body, and soul.

One such moment for me was receiving a grade of 1.0 in our Anatomy subject, a challenging subject that tested my perseverance and resilience. Yet, kahit may mga academic trials, isa sa mga nag stand out as vibrant highlight ng aking pagiging Fine Arts Student ay ang pag participate sa mga various student art competitions. Not only did these events ignite yung aking creative passion, but they also provided the opportunity to forge connections with students from other schools. Yung friendship, nanganak lang from shared artistic endeavors, mga struggle when joing a competitions, na I think nag-enriched sa aming mga buhay with lasting fellowship and support."
